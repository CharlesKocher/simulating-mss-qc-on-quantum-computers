Code used for the SC18 poster submission "Simulating Mini-Superspace Quantum Cosmology on Quantum Computers". Follow the instructions in the code appendix to reproduce the results.

NOTE: QISKit ACQUA is a very active repository. No attempt will be made to keep this code updated (eg, if it is renamed to "aqua", none of this code will be modified).
